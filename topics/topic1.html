<div class="section">
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>C is one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages in the world. Developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie, C forms the foundation of modern programming. Languages like C++, Java, Python, and many others are influenced by C. It is known for its speed, efficiency, and full control over hardware, making it a preferred choice for operating systems, embedded devices, and high-performance applications.</p>

<h2>2. Why C Is Important?</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is the **mother of all languages**.</li>
<li>Used to build **operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS)**.</li>
<li>Used in **embedded systems**, robots, and IoT devices.</li>
<li>Best for **learning memory management**.</li>
<li>Fast, portable, and extremely efficient.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Basic Structure of a C Program</h2>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This is the skeleton of every C program. The <b>main()</b> function is the entry point.</p>
