    <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>

    <p>
      Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its
      readability, concise syntax, and large standard library. Created by Guido van
      Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes developer productivity and
      code clarity. It is used everywhere — web development, data science, automation,
      scripting, DevOps, and education.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes Python special?</h2>
    <p>
      Python has a simple, English-like syntax that makes it accessible to beginners
      while being powerful for experts. Key features include dynamic typing, automatic
      memory management (garbage collection), first-class functions, rich data
      structures (lists, dicts, sets), and a mature ecosystem of libraries (NumPy,
      pandas, Flask, Django, TensorFlow).
    </p>

    <h2>Python execution model</h2>
    <p>
      Python code runs in an interpreter. The most common implementation is CPython,
      which compiles source code to bytecode executed by a virtual machine. There are
      other implementations (PyPy for speed, Jython for Java integration, IronPython
      for .NET). For performance-critical parts, developers may use C extensions.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting started — example</h2>
<pre>
# Hello world in Python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Vipul"))
</pre>

    <h2>Where to go from here</h2>
    <p>
      Start by learning core syntax (variables, control flow, functions), then
      practice small projects (to-do app, scraper, data explorer). Explore virtual
      environments (venv), pip for package management, and read the official docs at
      python.org.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Python’s balance of simplicity and power makes it a top choice for beginners and
      professionals. Mastering Python opens many paths — backend development, data
      engineering, automation, and ML.
