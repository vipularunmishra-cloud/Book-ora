<h1>Databases</h1>
<p>
A database is a structured system for storing, managing, and retrieving data. Websites,
mobile apps, banks, and companies all use databases to keep their information organized.
There are two main types: SQL (structured) and NoSQL (unstructured).
</p>

<h2>SQL Databases</h2>
<p>
SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite use tables, rows, and columns.
They follow ACID principles and are used in banking, booking systems, and applications
that require accuracy and structure. Queries are written using SQL language.
</p>

<h2>NoSQL Databases</h2>
<p>
NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Firebase, and Cassandra handle flexible, large, or 
unpredictable data. They store information in formats like documents or key-value pairs.
These are used in social networks, AI systems, and apps with millions of users.
</p>

<h2>Why Databases Matter</h2>
<p>
Every full-stack application needs a backend database. Understanding how data is stored,
retrieved, and updated is essential for modern app development.
