<h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<p>
An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages hardware resources
and provides services to applications. Without an OS, a computer cannot run
programs, manage memory, or interact with hardware. Popular OS include
Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
</p>

<h2>Functions of an OS</h2>
<p>
The OS manages memory, processes, hardware, file systems, user interfaces,
and system security. It allocates CPU time to programs, ensures smooth
multitasking, and protects data from unauthorized access.
</p>

<h2>Types of OS</h2>
<p>
- **Batch OS** – processes jobs in batches without user interaction.<br>
- **Multitasking OS** – runs multiple programs simultaneously.<br>
- **Real-Time OS** – used in embedded systems where response time is critical.<br>
- **Mobile OS** – optimized for touch screens and low-power devices.
</p>

<h2>Why OS is Important</h2>
<p>
Understanding operating systems is essential for programming, cybersecurity,
and system design. It helps developers optimize software performance and
interact with system-level features efficiently.
