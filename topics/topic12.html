<h1>Computer Networks</h1>
<p>
A computer network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate and
share resources. The internet itself is a massive global network. Networks
enable communication, data transfer, remote access, and resource sharing.
</p>

<h2>Types of Networks</h2>
<p>
- **LAN (Local Area Network)** – small area like home, office, school.<br>
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** – connects large geographical areas.<br>
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** – used in cities.<br>
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)** – Bluetooth devices.
</p>

<h2>Network Devices</h2>
<p>
Routers, switches, modems, repeaters, and access points help route data and
maintain network stability. Each device has a specific function in ensuring
data flows efficiently.
</p>

<h2>Protocols & IP Addressing</h2>
<p>
Protocols like TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP define rules for communication.
Every device on a network has an IP address that helps identify it.
IPv4 and IPv6 are the two versions of addressing systems.
