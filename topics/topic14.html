<h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
<p>
Artificial Intelligence is the ability of computers to perform tasks that
normally require human intelligence. These include learning, reasoning,
problem-solving, decision-making, and understanding language or images.
AI powers virtual assistants, self-driving cars, search engines, and more.
</p>

<h2>Types of AI</h2>
<p>
- **Narrow AI** – specialized tasks like Siri, Google Maps.<br>
- **General AI** – human-like intelligence (still theoretical).<br>
- **Machine Learning** – computers learn patterns from data.<br>
- **Deep Learning** – advanced form using neural networks.
</p>

<h2>Applications of AI</h2>
<p>
AI is used in healthcare, finance, gaming, robotics, education, marketing, and
cybersecurity. It analyzes huge amounts of data and makes predictions faster
than humans.
</p>

<h2>Why AI is the Future</h2>
<p>
AI is revolutionizing industries, creating new jobs, and automating repetitive
tasks. Learning AI concepts opens opportunities in data science, automation,
and software engineering.
