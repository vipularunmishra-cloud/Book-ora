<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
<p>
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where computers learn automatically
from data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms identify patterns,
make predictions, and improve with experience.
</p>

<h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
<p>
- **Supervised Learning** – learns from labeled data (e.g., email spam detection).<br>
- **Unsupervised Learning** – finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer grouping).<br>
- **Reinforcement Learning** – learns through rewards and punishments (e.g., game bots).
</p>

<h2>ML Algorithms</h2>
<p>
Popular algorithms include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests,
K-Means Clustering, and Neural Networks. ML applications rely on statistical
techniques and optimization methods.
</p>

<h2>Where ML Is Used</h2>
<p>
Machine learning powers recommendation systems (YouTube, Amazon), fraud detection,
face recognition, voice assistants, and medical diagnosis. It is one of the most
in-demand fields in the tech world.
