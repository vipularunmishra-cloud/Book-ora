<h1>Data Structures</h1>
<p>
Data structures are methods of organizing and storing data in a computer so it
can be accessed and modified efficiently. Good choice of data structure
improves performance and reduces memory usage.
</p>

<h2>Types of Data Structures</h2>
<p>
<b>1. Linear:</b>  
Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.  
These follow a sequential order.

<b>2. Non-Linear:</b>  
Trees, Graphs.  
These allow hierarchical and network-like connections.
</p>

<h2>Common Data Structures Explained</h2>
<p>
<b>Array:</b> Fixed-size, stored in contiguous memory.  
<b>Linked List:</b> Nodes connected by pointers.  
<b>Stack:</b> LIFO order (Undo button).  
<b>Queue:</b> FIFO order (Printers).  
<b>Tree:</b> Hierarchical (File system).  
<b>Graph:</b> Used in networks, maps, social connections.
</p>

<h2>Why They Matter</h2>
<p>
Data structures are essential for algorithms, app development, game engines,
and competitive programming. Efficient software is impossible without them.
