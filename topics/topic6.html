<h1>HTML & CSS Basics</h1>
<p>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to structure web pages.
It defines the layout of content through tags. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to
style and visually format the HTML structure. Together, they form the foundation of all
web development. HTML provides the skeleton while CSS provides the design and appearance.
</p>

<h2>HTML Structure</h2>
<p>
An HTML document begins with the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration, followed by 
the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. Inside it, we have the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which stores metadata,
and the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, which contains everything that displays on the screen. Common HTML tags
include headings (h1–h6), paragraphs (p), images (img), links (a), divisions (div), lists (ul/ol),
and more.
</p>

<h2>CSS Basics</h2>
<p>
CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout, borders, animations, and responsiveness. CSS 
can be applied in three ways: inline, internal, and external. The most powerful and 
professional way is external CSS using a file like <code>style.css</code>. CSS works with selectors
and properties. For example, <code>p { color: blue; }</code> changes all paragraphs to blue.
</p>

<h2>Why HTML & CSS Matter</h2>
<p>
Every website on the internet uses HTML and CSS. Without learning them, advanced subjects
like JavaScript, React, or backend development cannot be understood properly. They also
help in frontend interviews and form the first step toward mastering web design.
