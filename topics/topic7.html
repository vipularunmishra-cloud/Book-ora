<h1>Cybersecurity</h1>

<p>
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. These attacks aim to access, change, or destroy information, steal money, or disrupt services.
</p>

<h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters</h2>
<p>
As everything becomes digital—banking, healthcare, education, communication—cyber threats have increased. Hackers constantly try to break into systems for profit or disruption.
</p>

<h2>Common Cyber Threats</h2>
<h3>1. Malware</h3>
<p>Software designed to harm systems—viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware.</p>

<h3>2. Phishing</h3>
<p>Fake emails or messages trick users into revealing personal information.</p>

<h3>3. DDoS Attacks</h3>
<p>Overloading a server to make a service unavailable.</p>

<h3>4. SQL Injection</h3>
<p>Injecting malicious SQL queries into websites to steal data.</p>

<h3>5. Man-in-the-Middle Attack</h3>
<p>Intercepting communication between two people.</p>

<h2>Best Security Practices</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use strong passwords</li>
<li>Enable two-factor authentication</li>
<li>Never click unknown links</li>
<li>Keep software updated</li>
<li>Avoid using public WiFi for banking</li>
</ul>

<p>Cybersecurity is essential to survive in a connected world.</p>
