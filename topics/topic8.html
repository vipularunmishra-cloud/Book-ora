<h1>Computer Hardware</h1>

<p>
Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system. These parts work together to run software and perform operations.
</p>

<h2>Main Hardware Components</h2>

<h3>1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>
<p>
The brain of the computer. It performs calculations and executes instructions.
</p>

<h3>2. RAM (Random Access Memory)</h3>
<p>
Temporary memory used to store running applications and data. More RAM = faster performance.
</p>

<h3>3. Storage (SSD/HDD)</h3>
<p>
Long-term data storage. SSDs are faster; HDDs are cheaper.
</p>

<h3>4. GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h3>
<p>
Used for graphics rendering, gaming, video editing, and AI workloads.
</p>

<h3>5. Motherboard</h3>
<p>
The main circuit board that connects all components.
</p>

<h3>6. Power Supply (PSU)</h3>
<p>
Converts electricity into usable power for PC components.
</p>

<h3>7. Cooling System</h3>
<p>
Prevents overheating using fans or liquid cooling.
</p>

<p>
Hardware evolves quickly—modern systems are faster, smaller, and more energy efficient.
