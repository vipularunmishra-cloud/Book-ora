<h1>Data Structures</h1>
<p>
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and
used efficiently. Every program deals with data, and choosing the right data structure
is essential for performance. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists,
stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
</p>

<h2>Arrays & Linked Lists</h2>
<p>
Arrays store elements in continuous memory, making them easy to access using an index.
However, inserting or deleting in the middle is slow. Linked lists solve this by storing
each element as a node connected with pointers, allowing fast insertions but slower
random access.
</p>

<h2>Stacks & Queues</h2>
<p>
A stack uses LIFO (Last In First Out), meaning the last element added is removed first.
A queue uses FIFO (First In First Out). These structures are used in recursion, 
task scheduling, browser history, and more.
</p>

<h2>Trees & Graphs</h2>
<p>
Trees represent hierarchical data like folder structures, while graphs represent
connections such as social networks or maps. They are essential for designing 
algorithms and handling real-world complex relationships.
