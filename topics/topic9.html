<h1>Algorithms</h1>
<p>
An algorithm is a step-by-step method of solving a problem. Good algorithms are efficient,
fast, and optimized. Every computer program, from calculators to AI systems, uses 
algorithms. Big-O notation helps measure how efficient an algorithm is based on time and 
memory usage.
</p>

<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<p>
Sorting algorithms arrange data in a specific order. Popular types include Bubble Sort,
Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Merge Sort and Quick Sort 
are much faster and used in real-world applications.
</p>

<h2>Searching Algorithms</h2>
<p>
Searching is used to find elements in data. Linear search checks one-by-one, while 
binary search is much faster and works on sorted data. Modern systems heavily use 
search algorithms to manage huge datasets.
</p>

<h2>Pathfinding Algorithms</h2>
<p>
Algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* find the shortest path between two points. They are 
used in navigation apps, games, robotics, and AI systems.
